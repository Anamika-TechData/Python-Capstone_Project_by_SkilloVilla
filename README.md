# Employee, Project & Status Data Analysis

## 📌 Project Summary
Analyzed three interrelated datasets (**Employee, Project, Status**) to create accurate, management-ready reports.  
The project involved **data cleaning, transformation, merging, and business rule application**, resulting in **95% improved reporting readiness**.  


## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, inconsistent formats)  
- Data Transformation (merging datasets, reformatting fields)  
- Numerical Computations with **NumPy** (running average for missing project costs)  
- Data Analysis with **Pandas** (bonus calculations, city-level filtering)  
- Report Generation (summary CSV outputs)  


## 📂 Deliverables
- ✅ Cleaned and merged dataset (CSV format)  
- ✅ Jupyter Notebook with full workflow  
- ✅ Summary reports filtered by city  


## 📊 Workflow
1. Imported raw datasets (`Employee`, `Project`, `Status`)  
2. Cleaned missing values and inconsistent formats  
3. Applied running average algorithm to fill missing project costs  
4. Merged datasets into a single, structured file  
5. Calculated bonuses based on business rules  
6. Generated summary reports with **city-based filters**  


## 🚀 Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x**  
- **Pandas**  
- **NumPy**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  


## 📈 Key Outcome
✔️ Delivered a **fully cleaned dataset** and **actionable reports**  
✔️ Improved reporting accuracy and readiness by **95%**  
✔️ Enabled faster, data-driven decision-making for management
