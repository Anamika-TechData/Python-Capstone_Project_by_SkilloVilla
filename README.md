#  📊 Python-Capstone_Project_by_SkilloVilla

## 📌 Project Summary
Analyzed three interrelated datasets (**Employee, Project, Status**) to create accurate, management-ready reports.  
The project involved **data cleaning, transformation, merging, and business rule application**, resulting in **95% improved reporting readiness**.  


## 🛠️ Skills Demonstrated
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing (handling missing values, inconsistent formats)  
- Data Transformation (merging datasets, reformatting fields)  
- Numerical Computations with **NumPy** (running average for missing project costs)  
- Data Analysis with **Pandas** (bonus calculations, city-level filtering)  
- Report Generation (summary CSV outputs)  


## 📂 Deliverables
- ✅ Cleaned and merged dataset (CSV format)    


## 📊 Workflow
1. Imported raw datasets (`Employee`, `Project`, `Status`)  
2. Cleaned missing values and inconsistent formats  
3. Applied running average algorithm to fill missing project costs  
4. Merged datasets into a single, structured file  
5. Generated summary reports with **city-based filters**  


## ⚙️ Technologies Used  

- **Language:** Python 3.x  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas  
- **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook  
- **Data Storage:** CSV files  
  - Employee Dataset  
  - Seniority Dataset
